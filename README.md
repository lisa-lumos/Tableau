# Tableau Summary
This file is a summary of Tableau features (`what it can do`), NOT an instruction on how to use each of the features. It is intended to give reader an overview of what they can do in Tableau, and therefore know what keywords to search for in Google Search or Tableau Documentation go to learn it. It contains `no redundant sentences, no BS`. 

This file is mainly intended for Tableau Desktop, because a senior analyst told me this is the most commonly used Tableau version among his projects over the past 10 years. 

This file will be updated daily until complete.

## üè∑ Connect to data
Tableau supports connecting to `hundreds of data sources`, including a number of different `flat file types` as well as a wide range of `server-based data sources`. E.g., to your computer in a spreadsheet or a text file, or in a database on a server. 

Two data connection options: use `live connection (default)`, or use an `extract`. 

A `live connection` is a direct connection to your data, best used when you want to `leverage a high performance database‚Äôs capabilities`, or get `real time changes` in viz (when you refresh it...). Sometimes, connecting live can result in a slow experience, depending on the database. You can `manually refresh` the live connection; Tableau will also `refresh the data automatically each time you open` the workbook.

An `extract` is a compressed snapshot of data stored locally. Useful when you `connect to a slow database` or when you want to `take query load off critical systems`. You can also choose to `import only some of the data` to the extract. 

### Metadata
Tableau assigns `metadata` to the data that you bring into it; you can edit the metadata to decide `how the fields to look and function` in a view. It includes the `names of fields`, `data types`, `aggregation information`, and `default display properties`, etc. 

### The Data Source page
In the `data grid` in the `Data Source page`, Tableau shows `some of the metadata` for the dataset, such as `data role` and `field name`. Tableau distinguishes numbers from strings and dates from dates with timestamps etc. Tableau represents these data role assignments with an icon near the field label. For example, Tableau recognizes City as a geographic entity, and therefore assigns it a `Geographic Role` (a common data role), connecting that field to Tableau's generated latitude and longitude coordinates. Note: `This does not change the data type`, which will remain as a string in this case. You can `make edits to the metadata` right `from the data grid`, such as `changing data role` for a field, `rename` a field. 

The `data grid view` and be switched to `metadata grid view`, which shows each field in a row, where you can `rename fields`, or `hide multiple fields at once`. Changes to the metadata in Tableau `don't impact the source data`.

### The Tableau workspace
In `the Tableau workspace`, the `Data pane` on the left lists the fields in the data source, organized into `dimensions`(blue icons) and `measures`(green icons). You can `drag` the fields from the `Data pane` to the `cards` and `shelves` to begin creating viz. You can also `rename fields` from the data pane. 

The `Pages shelf` lets you break a view into a series of pages to navigate your data like a flip-book animation. It can help analyze data changes and discover hidden insights. 

The `Filters shelf` lets you specify which data to include and exclude, to narrow your viz to the most useful information. 

The `Columns and Rows shelves` let you drop fields to create structure of viz.

The `Marks card` let you drop fields to add context and detail to the viz, such as setting mark type, color, size, shape, text, and detail. 

## üè∑ Customize data source
Could do cleanup and organization as you work with the underlying source data, include customizations like `connection information`, `organizational or metadata changes`, `attributes`, or `aliases`. Tableau Desktop allows us to `save these data source customizations for reuse`. It preserves the customizations you make, but it does not change the underlying source data.

Common `changes to data attributes` fall into several categories, all of which are `saved in a Tableau data source (.tds) file`:
- Folder structure
- Measure and dimension conversions
- Field data types (e.g., strings, integers, dates)
- Field properties (e.g., how a field is displayed or aggregated)
- Attributes (e.g., field names)

### Organize fields into folders
Useful when you have `a large number of fields in the Data pane`. For example, you may want to organize all the customer fields, such as Customer Name and Customer ID, into a new folder called "Customer Info."

### Convert fields from measures to dimensions
Tableau automatically predicts and assigns fields to dimensions or measures, but you can `change it from one to the other`. 

### Edit attributes
Tableau allows you to `rename` any of the database fields. 

### Create aliases to rename members in the view
Tableau allows you to create `aliases` for values (labels) inside a field. 

### Edit a field‚Äôs default properties (Tableau Desktop only)
You can edit `a field‚Äôs default properties`, such as `color`, `number format`, or `aggregation`. This way, every time you add the field to the view, it will maintain its assigned properties.

### Tableau data source (.tds) file
Tableau Desktop can save your customizations (metadata changes) of your data source to a local file in the `Tableau data source (.tds) format`. You can `reuse` the .tds file in different workbooks and `share` the .tds file with other users.

Included in a .tds file:
- Measures converted to dimensions, and Dimensions converted to measures
- Edited field aliases
- Modified default field properties
- Calculated fields
- Groups
- Sets

Not included in a .tds file:
- Login info 
- Vizzes created with the data

### Refresh a viz to reflect new data
Tableau is flexible about `data source updates`. `Adding more columns or rows` to the data source won‚Äôt break the viz. 

However, `there are some updates that Tableau can‚Äôt accommodate`, like `changes to the structure of the dataset`, such as `rename or remove columns`. Viz will only be impacted by changes to fields that is uses. It can be fixed by replace references for that field. 

### Data extract
A `data extract` is a local subset of a data source: 
- You can create extracts that contain `billions of rows` of data.
- Can be `faster` than working with the original data, because they are usually `smaller` than the original data source. Generally experience `better performance` than the live connections to the original data.
- Allow you to take advantage of `additional functionality` that's not available or supported by the original data, such as the ability to compute a distinct count.
- Allow you to save and work with the data `locally` when the original data is not available. Provide `offline access`, `portable`. 
- An extract is a subset of the data, which `limits access to the remainder of the data`. This can aid in data security, administration, and load on workbooks.
- When the original data changes, you need to `manually refresh` the extract. Extracts can be configured to be `full refresh` (default, can take long time for large extracts), replacing all of the data with what‚Äôs in the original data source, or `incremental refresh`, adding just the new rows since the previous refresh. An incremental refresh is only possible when you are extracting `all rows` in the database. For `Tableau Desktop`, you can `automate extract refreshes` using the Tableau Data Extract Command Line Utility. For `web authoring`, you can `schedule refresh task`s for `published` extract data sources and published workbooks that connect to extracts. 
- Unfamiliar users `may not realize that some data has been filtered` from the original data source. A good design practice for extracts is to `inform the end user` about what is included and not included in the extract via notes or instructions in the views and dashboards.

**Best practices for incremental extract refreshes:**
- Use full refresh whenever possible. 
- Incremental refreshed extracts should be fully refreshed at regular intervals (e.g. every weekend or monthly) to maximize performance.

Beginning with Tableau version 10.5, when you create a new extract, it uses the `.hyper format`, which takes advantage of the improved data engine which supports faster analytical and query performance for larger data sets. When you perform an extract-related task on a (old) `.tde` format using Tableau version 10.5 or later, the extract is `upgraded to a .hyper` format. After a .tde extract is upgraded to a .hyper extract, it `can't be reverted back`. 

To create an extract, you can do it from the `Data Source page`, or from the `worksheet` so you can choose to only extract the part of data used in the view. Start the extract creation from the worksheet allows you to `configure the extract before Tableau creates it` - can save time for large data sources. You can edit a  extract after you have created it. 

In web authoring (requires Creator role), you can create extracts directly with default extract settings. Extract refreshes for web authors requires Tableau Bridge. 

**Best practices for creating a data extract:**
- `Aggregate` data: so it is much smaller than the transaction level data extract,  which improves query performance.
- `Hide` all unused fields: it can speed extract creation and to preserve storage space.
- `Filter` data:  remove data you do not need.

### Logical tables vs. physical tables in an extract
Two ways to store data in extract: `logical tables` or `physical tables`:
- `Recommended:  Logical tables`, which is the default.
- The `Physical tables` option should be used `sparingly` to help with specific situations such as when the `size of your extract is larger than expected`.

**Logical tables:**

If you use `Logical tables` when your extract contains `joins`, the `joins are applied` when the extract is created.

Use Logical tables when:

- you want to limit the amount of data in your extract with additional extract properties like `extract filters, aggregation, Top N`, or other features that require denormalized data.
- your data uses `pass-through functions (RAWSQL)`.

**Physical tables:**

Physical table uses one extract table for each physical table in the data source. If you use the physical tables, `joins are performed at query time`. Also, you `cannot append data` to it.

Use Physical tables when:
- your extract has `tables created with one or more equality joins` and meets all of these conditions: All joins between physical tables are equality (=) joins; Data types used for relationships or joins are identical; No pass-through functions (RAWSQL) used; No incremental refresh configured; No extract filters configured; No Top N or sampling configured
- the size of your extract is `larger than expected`.

## üè∑ Organize data and create filters
### Group
A group lets you combine several `members` (values) `inside a single dimension (field)` into `a single data point` or `category type`, `aka, combine into one member`, by `creating a new dimension` that didn‚Äôt originally exist in your data. The new group can be used repeatedly in vizzies. Existing groups can be edited. 

Groups in Tableau are represented by a `paper clip`: <img src="images/group.png" style="width: 2%">. In the `Data pane`, the paper clip to the left of the field indicates a grouped field. In the `tooltip` in the `view`, the paper clip is the `Group Members button` that creates a group.

Groups can be used in diverse ways to answer questions about your data:
- `Ad hoc analysis` - Grouping the destinations that loses the most airline packages that allows the company to discover what they have in common. Group sales of previous exhibits by audience to determine which brought the most visitors in the past. 
- `"What if" scenarios`: Determine what will bring the most profit for future investments by grouping long list of products into categories, to make informed decisions based upon overall profit. 
- `Correcting data errors`: Avoid data duplication (typos): Grouping CA, Calif., and California into one data point. Name changes: A product is renamed, but product itself didn't change - grouping allow to see sales before and after the name change.
- `Reuse`: After the groups are created, they can be used in other ways. 

Groups can be created using:
- `A field in the Data pane`: good for long lists, allows search (exact match, contains, starts with), can drag a member into an existing group in the window, can choose to create a "Other" group to group all the un-grouped members. 
- `Labels or marks in the view`: when you select multiple labels or marks, use the pop up tooltip window to group them. During this process, a group contains selected items is created, also a group called others is created. The newly created group field is instantly used in the view. 

### Hierarchy
A hierarchy is an arrangement of data fields in a hierarchical format with an "above" and "below" structure. A hierarchy preserves the ordering, creates drilling capabilities in the visualization,  and it can be used over and over. Its icon: <img src="images/hierarchy.png" style="width: 2%">. 

One of the most useful ways to navigate hierarchies is to drill down using the [+] or drill up using the [-] to hide or display the related fields. The symbol appears on the left of the field when it's on a shelf, on the Marks card, or in the view. 

Date hierarchies: For relational data sources, dates and times are automatically placed in the dimensions area of the Data pane and are identified by the date icon <img src="images/date.png" style="width: 2%">, or date-time icon <img src="images/datetime.png" style="width: 2%">, and can be drilled up and down as a hierarchy. Date fields can consist of Year, Quarter, Month, Day, Time. Notice that the list order must be preserved for the hierarchy to make sense.

Common examples of subjects with hierarchical categories: Biological classification, Family tree, Geographical locations. 

### Filters
Filtering does not remove or modify data, it just changes the data that appears in your view. 

Filter types
- **Extract filters**
When creating an extract, filter out irrelevant data. 

- **Data source filters**
Reduce the amount of data being fed into Tableau. Can be used to filter out sensitive data from data source. For systems that rely heavily on partitions or indexing, data source filters may yield tremendous control over the performance of queries issued by Tableau. 

- **Context filters**
All filters in Tableau are computed independently. Context filter is processed first. If you have two dimension filters, one on Region and another top 3 on products, both filters will apply to the entire data set, e.g: product A, D, F are globally top 3, but only A lives through the region filter, so the final result will show only product A. If you want to see the top 3 products in each region, need to set Region as the context filter, in this way, product A, B, C might be the top 3 and all will show up. Context filters are greyed out in the filter pane. 

- **Dimension filters**
Dimensions contain discrete categorical data, so filtering it involves selecting the values to include or exclude. For example, use a dimension filter to show sales in specific regions.

- **Measure filters**
Measures contain quantitative data, so filtering it involves selecting a range of values that you want to include. For example, show only products that have sales greater than 10,000.

- **Date filters**
Date filters allow you to filter data by a range of dates, relative dates, or exact dates. For example, show products that have been ordered starting January 2017. 

- **Table Calculation filters**
Applied after the view has been produced. Suitable if you want to filter the view without filtering the underlying data.

Order of Filters:

<img src="images/filter-order.png" style="width: 60%">

Dimension filter: The easiest way is to include or exclude data points (marks) from your view. Another way is to drag the dimension field from the Data pane to the Filters shelf.

Filters can be created on fields that are not in the view. On Tableau Desktop, you can right click fields in data pane and select show filter. Filters can be reused across worksheets (not default). In filter window, 'Use all' is dynamic and adapts to changes, 'Select from' is static and ignores changes. 

You can customize the look and interaction of a filter. The Remove Filter option removes the filter from the Filters shelf. Hide Card/Filter only removes the filter card from the view. 

Tableau can create filters on continuous date values or discrete date parts. For continuous data filter, you can filter by relative dates, range of dates, starting date, ending date, and special (null). 

### Sorting
Computed sort (dynamic) and manual sort. As an author, you can disable the sort icons in published content.

When the values to be sorted occur in multiple panes in a view, there are two ways to sort: nested sort (considers each pane independently and sorts the rows per pane) and non-nested sort (default, considers the value across panes and will have the same order of values per pane).

### Set
Sets are custom binary fields that define a subset of data - for viewing and highlighting data that meet specific criteria. For instance, sets can help you identify customers with sales exceeding a certain threshold. Set can be dynamic (members change with data, can be based on single or multiple dimensions), or fixed (members do not change with data, based on a single dimension only). Sets can be reused throughout the workbook, and it is part of the metadata and saved in .tds file. Sets can be used like any other field in a view (to encode marks, use in calculated fields, use as dimensions (in/out a set), use as filters). 

Use cases for sets:
- View or highlight data that meets a specific computed condition, for example, a set  contains customers with sales exceeding a certain amount.
- Monitor key data points, for example, high- or low-performing sales regions.
- Show members in a field that meets a few conditions, e.g., items that are top sellers but are also highly discounted.
- part-to-whole comparison
- part-to-part comparison (set to set)

You can create a fixed set by selecting marks in a view or using the Create Set option for a dimension from the Data pane. 

In Tableau Desktop, you can combine two sets - you create a new set containing either the combination of all members, just the members that exist in both, or members that exist in one set but not the other. To combine two sets, they must be members of the same field.

To give your audience the ability to quickly modify members of a dynamic set, you can also display a set control. A set control is a worksheet card that is very similar to a parameter control or filter card.

Based on the filter order, Tableau applies set filters before dimension and measure filters. 

## üè∑ Build views
### Visualize time-based data
Tableau provides two ways to visualize date fields: as continuous date values or discrete date parts (default); they are interchangeable in the data pane. Continuous date values, also called date values, represent the chronological progression of time. Date values appear as green fields when placed on a shelf. Discrete date parts are distinct units of time contained in your data. 

Use continuous date values to visualize how your data changes over a range of time. Use discrete date parts when you want to compare a measure for specific units of time

When you add a date field to a view, Tableau automatically selects the highest discrete date part (default) in your data to display. You can change it. 

Note that selecting "Discrete" or "Continuous" from the date field drop-down menu will not change whether a date field is used as a discrete date part or a continuous date value in the view, it will only change how the data is displayed (as headers or axis). You need to select explicitly the lod of the continuous date or discrete date in this dropdown menu. 

If your organization uses a week-based calendar, with Monday as the first day of the week, you can specify the ISO-8601 calendar as your preference for your data source. This change will apply to all worksheets using the data source, affecting date fields, context menus, filters, and so on. 

You can create `custom date fields` in Tableau Desktop, using discrete dates part or continuous date values, and use them in views so they provide users the exact experience you want. Custom date field has a plus sign in its icon. 

You can create a custom date hierarchy from discrete date parts. 

The Data pane always contains several fields that do not exist in your original data source, two of these are Measure Values and Measure Names - they serve as containers for the measures in the Data pane. Tableau automatically creates these two fields for each data source when you connect it to a workbook. 

The Measure Values field is a measure that contains the values of the measures. The Measure Names field is a dimension that contains the names of the measures. Note that it does not include measures such as Latitude, which do not aggregate the same way as other measures.

Text tables can contain up to fifty measures on Rows and sixteen on Columns. Measures in a text table use the text mark.

You can build dual-axis charts in Tableau - you need two measures and one/more dimensions. 

You can add annotation to data points in a view. 

Text tables can be used for drilling down from summary visualizations to more detailed information, such as when a text table is used as a filter in part of a dashboard. You can create a text table from an existing view or from scratch. You can use the Analysis menu to add these aggregations (such as totals, subtotals, or averages of columns and rows to provide users with high-level information) to a text table.

A highlight table enables you to apply color to a text table when you need to show every value but also want to show patterns or extreme values.

Pie charts are built solely on the Marks card (Angle); no fields are placed on rows or columns.

Tree maps display data in nested rectangles. Dimensions define the structure of the tree map, and measures define the size and color of the individual rectangles. Tree maps and pie charts are good choices for showing part-to-whole comparisons. But, unlike pie charts, tree maps are good for displaying data sets with long tails, those that have many small values that contribute to the whole dataset. The basic building blocks for a tree map are the Automatic or Square mark type, one measure on Color and Size, and one dimension on Detail. By default, when building a tree map, negative values are hidden from the view. In Tableau Desktop you can click the button on the right bottom of the view, and choose to Use Absolute Values. 

You can build word clouds and packed bubble charts from tree maps by changing the mark type to text. 

Bar-in-bar charts and bullet graphs have a similar goal: to compare two values in a bar chart-style view. In a bar-in-bar chart, you're usually comparing two measures against one another. In a bullet graph, you're usually comparing a measure against a goal or threshold which is a reference line, and can have reference bands. Both the bar-in-bar chart and the bullet graph are derived from the side-by-side bar chart, but the former two are visually less crowded and more direct‚Äîmaking the information easier to see and understand.

## üè∑ Map geographic data
### Symbol and Filled maps
Two map types in Tableau: `symbol maps` (uses symbols to represent a central point of a geographic region, effective for showing quantitative data for individual locations,  work best with data containing large variations of values) and `filled maps` (shows boundaries of a geographic region, filled with color, ideal for showing ratio data). 

When building map views, Tableau supports any latitude and longitude coordinates, as long as they are in decimal degrees. Tableau can also recognize and geocode the following geographic information types: Worldwide airport codes, Cities, Countries , Regions , Territories, States , Provinces, Some postcodes and second-level administrative districts (county-equivalents) , Core Based Statistical Areas (CBSA), U.S. area codes, Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA) , Congressional districts , Zip codes. 

For a symbol map, use the following building blocks in the Tableau workspace:
| Place | Content |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Columns shelf | Longitude (continuous measure, longitude geographic role assigned) |
| Rows shelf | Latitude (continuous measure, latitude geographic role assigned) |
| Detail | One or more dimensions |
| Size | Measure (aggregated) |
| Mark type | Automatic |

For a filled map, use the following building blocks in the Tableau workspace:
| Place | Content |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Columns shelf | Longitude (continuous measure, longitude geographic role assigned) |
| Rows shelf | Latitude (continuous measure, latitude geographic role assigned) |
| Detail | One or more geographic units (dimensions with geographic roles assigned) |
| Size | Measure or dimension |
| Mark type | Automatic or Map |
	
You can resolve ambiguous geocoded location data by: Specifying the Country/Region and/or State/Province for your data.

A filled map shows ratio or aggregated data in shapes known as polygons. The polygons can be countries, regions, states, or almost any area that can be geocoded in Tableau. (An exception is cities, which won't allow for a filled area.) The distribution you specify for the color of the polygons (gradients vs. stepped, and the number of steps) highly affects how people interpret your data. To make the variation more apparent, reduce the number of visible color shades on the map. The level of detail you specify in a filled map determines the patterns you want to see in the data. To simplify the pattern, aggregate up to a higher level of detail. To make smaller trends more visible, aggregate down to a lower level of detail. 
	
### Density Maps
A density map shows the frequency of marks in an area. By grouping overlapping marks, and color-coding them based on the amount of overlap, you can create a density map to reveal trends.

Density maps are most effective when the location data is very precise, such as location coordinates in a limited space. For example, events associated with specific street-level addresses. Additionally, density maps work best where the specific locations change continuously and smoothly across space, rather than values constrained to discrete locations such as district, borough, or neighborhood. The density mark can be useful with scatter plots, too, especially if you‚Äôre more interested in the patterns than the outliers.

For a density map, use the following building blocks in the Tableau workspace:
| Place | Content |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Columns shelf | Longitude (continuous measure, longitude geographic role assigned) |
| Rows shelf | Latitude (continuous measure, latitude geographic role assigned) |
| Detail | One or more fields with many underlying data points |
| Mark type | Density |

## üè∑ Create calculated fields
Calculated fields allow you to create new fields from data that already exists in your data source. You can create calculated fields to compute a ratio, manipulate string and date fields, convert the data type of a field, and combine and aggregate data. A calculation, also known as a formula, includes some or all of these components: Fields, Functions, Operators, Parameters, Comments. After you build a calculated field, use it in your view just as you would any other field. 

You can also create ad-hoc calculations using existing fields or on an empty shelf in the view. To save an ad-hoc calculation for use in other workbook sheets, CTRL + drag it from the view to copy it to the Data pane, and you can rename it.

String functions allow you to manipulate data made of text, or string data. Common string functions: LEFT (string, number), RIGHT (string, number), SPLIT (string, delimiter, idx of substring start from 1), CONTAINS (string, substring), REPLACE (string, substring, replacement), UPPER (string), LOWER (string), TRIM (string). 

Type conversion functions allow you to convert fields from one data type to another. 

Tableau date parts include: 'year', 'quarter', 'month', 'dayofyear', 'day', 'weekday', 'week', 'hour', 'minute', 'second'.  Note that they must be singular, all lowercase, and wrapped in single quotation marks. Date functions include: DATEPART (returns a number), DATENAME (returns a string), DATEADD, DATEDIFF, DATETRUNC, MIN and MAX. 

If you are using a .hyper extract, date functions can also be calculated using the ISO 8601 Standard format, which differs from the Gregorian calendar because of how it calculates the starting week of a year. 

When Tableau automatically aggregates measure fields, SUM is the default aggregation. Aggregate functions allow you to summarize data by performing a calculation on a set of values at the level of detail in a view, and return a single value. For example, you might want to know the distinct count of attendees at your company‚Äôs annual conference over time. You can use the COUNTD function to calculate the distinct number of conference attendees and then break the visualization down by year. Aggregate functions: SUM, AVG, MEDIAN, COUNT, COUNTD, MIN, MAX.  

## üè∑ Apply Table calculations & Secondary table calculations
Table calculations are calculated fields that you apply to the values of a measure in a visualization. They compute the local data based on what is currently in the view. You can use table calculations to transform values to show rankings, running totals, percent of total, etc. You can use a quick table calculation using builtin calculations and preset configs, can manually configure calculations, and can build complex custom table calculations. 

List of quick table calculations:, Running Total, Difference, Percent Difference, Percent of Total, Rank, Percentile, Moving Average, YTD Total, YTD Growth, Compound Growth Rate, Year Over Year Growth. 

For difference calculation, you can hide or filter the null value, or show null data at default position. 

Scope refers to the segment of the data to which the calculation is applied. We can apply a table calculation to the values within a table, a pane (such as Category and Sub-Category), or a cell. Direction refers to whether the calculation is applied and computed across or down the defined scope. You can opt to show Row and/or Column Grand Totals. 

Table calculations are continuous measures by default, and continuous measures always display to the right of dimensions on a shelf, so we needed to convert the field from continuous to discrete before we could place it between dimensions on the shelf.

In the table calculation window, when selected, Show calculation assistance uses highlighting and numbering to demonstrate how the calculation is being computed. 

Table calculations are not automatically added to the Data pane, but you can save it manually by dragging it into the data pane and give it a name. Note that, when you use this field, it‚Äôs dependent on the other fields in the view, so it may need modification.

### Reference Lines and Bands
You can add reference lines, reference bands, distribution bands, and box plots to identify specific values or ranges on a continuous axis. You are able to create an unlimited number of reference lines, reference bands, distributions, and box plots.

### Parameters
A parameter is like a variable in an equation, where the value can be controlled by the end user. It could be anything, such as a number, date, or string that can replace a constant value in a calculation, filter, set, or reference line. 

For example, you may create a calculated field that returns True if Sales are greater than $2000 and otherwise returns False. You can replace the constant value of ‚Äú2000‚Äù in the formula with a parameter. Then, using the parameter control, users can dynamically change the threshold in your view.

Parameters let you 
- Dynamically modify values in a calculation. 
- Customize filters (for top N filter, N can be a parameter). 
- Dynamically modify a reference line, band, or box. 

Parameters vs filters:

| Parameters | Filters |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Able to select from a set of variables | Show a subset of the data |
| Unable to select multiple values | Able to select multiple values |
| Faster | Slower |
| Can be used in a calculated field | Cannot be used in a calculation |
| Support multiple datatypes | Do not support multiple datatypes |

Dynamic parameters updates automatically, and you can
- Link a data source field to the parameter‚Äôs list of values, so Tableau will pull the most up-to-date field values every time a user opens the workbook.
- Specify what the parameter‚Äôs current value should be when the workbook opens. 

Note that for dynamic parameters:
- The order in which dynamic parameters are populated is based on the default sort of the field. Default is the data source order. If you want new values to fill in at the bottom rather than alphabetically, set the default sort to manual.
- When setting the value to a calculated field, the calculation should be viz-independent. Also if using a Fixed LOD calculation, it cannot be a nested LOD calculation.

### Histograms (show distribution)
A histogram groups values together into buckets/bins that you define.

### Box & Whisker Plots (show distribution)
histograms show only one distribution of data along an axis; box & whisker plots are useful to compare multiple distributions of the data - they group values into four quartiles, with:
- the middle two quartiles constituting the "box" 
- the upper and lower quartiles located near the top and bottom as "whiskers".

Note that the IQR (InterQuartile Range) captures data that's 1.5 times the middle 50% of data, which sometimes results in values outside the whisker. Therefore it is a good plot for seeing outliers.

### Blend multiple data sources
You can also connect to multiple data sources at a time and use relationships, joins, unions, and blends to work with the data.
